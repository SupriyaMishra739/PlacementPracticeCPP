// 28. Write a code to find Find the ASCII value of a character
// This problem asks to find the ASCII value of a given character. The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) value of a character is its integer representation in the ASCII table.

// For example:
// The ASCII value of ‘A’ is 65.
// The ASCII value of ‘a’ is 97.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "The ASCII value of A is " << int('A') << endl;
    cout << "The ASCII value of a is " << int('a') << endl;
    cout << "The ASCII value of $ is " << int('$') << endl;
